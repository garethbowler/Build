					<h2>First Steps</h2>
				</div>

				<p>
				This is the Visa overview text, sed ut perspiciatis unde omnis iste natus error sit voluptatem accusantium doloremque laudantium, totam rem aperiam, eaque ipsa quae ab illo inventore veritatis et quasi architecto beatae vitae dicta sunt explicabo. Nemo enim ipsam voluptatem quia voluptas sit aspernatur aut odit aut fugit, sed quia consequuntur magni dolores eos qui ratione voluptatem sequi nesciunt.</p>

				<h4>WHO CAN APPLY FOR AN O-1 VISA?</h4>
				<p>An O-1 visa is a nonimmigrant-working visa for aliens of extraordinary ability. U.S. Citizenship & Immigration Services (USCIS)
				classifies aliens in the arts as O-1B. To successfully apply for this visa, aliens in the arts should be prominent in their field. To
				establish prominence the artist (also known as the beneficiary of the petition) must have evidence of public acclaim and
				distinction. This includes published press about the beneficiary, or evidence of exhibitions or awards. Prominence is also
				established with recommendation letters from experts in their field, which will also support the beneficiary’s credentials in
				other ways.</p>
				<h4>VISA DURATION</h4>
				<p>How Long Can I Stay with an O-1 Visa? <br>
				O-1 visas are issued for a maximum of three years. After that, O-1 visa status can be extended on a year-by-year basis.
				Beneficiaries can also apply at the U.S. Consulate in their country to extend their visas in three-year increments if they can
				show they have three years of new events scheduled.
				Successful applicants should be prepared to justify why they need to be in the U.S. for three years to complete an event (or
				series of events). A three-year itinerary of events will be prepared, and these events should be confirmed in writing. An
				example would be a letter from an art gallery that confirms that the artist will continually exhibit at the gallery over the
				three-year period.</p>
				<h4>PETITIONERS</h4>
				<p>To apply for an O-1 visa a foreign national must have an employer in the U.S. or a U.S. agent as his or her petitioner. Foreign
				nationals are not allowed to self-petition for an O-1 visa. You, the foreign national, are considered the beneficiary of a petition
				filed by someone else – your employer or U.S. agent.</p>
				<h4>EMPLOYER</h4>
				<p>An employer agrees to pay you directly for your services, and in many instances the employer will withhold certain taxes from
				your earnings. This is a traditional employment relationship and works very well with professionals who are traditionally
				employed by a company, firm or institution. Examples include architects and museum curators.<br>
				There are also instances where a company is a petitioner and the beneficiary is an independent contractor (where taxes are
				not withheld and the artist files his or her own taxes at the end of the year).<br>
				Employment can be full-time or part-time. The employer can confirm a series of assignments at a specific rate, or it can
				confirm a range of assignments and even a range of rates. USCIS has been shown to be extremely flexible with their
				acceptance of a variety of relationships. But a key to successful application is having these confirmed assignments stretch over
				the entire duration of the visa period.</p>
				<h4>US AGENT</h4>
				<p>U.S. Agent A U.S. agent represents you in occupations where you have more than one employer or are receiving confirmed
				assignments from more than one entity. U.S. agents sometimes receive a fee or commission for representing the artist. Some
				professionals work with artist representatives. Commercial photographers, illustrators and musicians often have artist
				representatives. An artist representative can serve as a U.S. Agent—but not all U.S. agents are artist representatives. Some U.S.
				agents will solicit work for an artist (for example an artist representative) while other U.S. agents are not looking for additional
				work for the artist but are merely confirming the assignments with multiple entities that are required by the O-1 petition. It
				should be noted as well that there are instances where an employer could additionally serve as a U.S. agent, thereby allowing a
				direct employment relationship and also the ability to perform services for other entities. <br><br>
				Contract between artist and U.S. agent: The beneficiary (artist) and petitioner (U.S. agent) sign a written agreement detailing
				the terms and conditions of their U.S. agent-artist relationship.<br><br>
				Contract between artist and employers confirming the assignments in the U.S.: The companies that will be confirming the
				events with the artist will sign an agreement that will be submitted with the visa application. This agreement describes the
				work to be performed by the artist, rate of pay, number of projects per year, and other terms and conditions of the assignment.
				This agreement will also acknowledge that the artist is represented by an U.S. agent, and that this agent will represent both the
				artist and employer for work performed by the artist in O-1 status in the United States.</p>

				
				<h2 id="who-qualifies" class="hidden-sm hidden-xs">Qualifying Criteria</h2>

				<div class="hidden-lg hidden-md col-xs-12 peach bar">
					<h2>Who Qualifies</h2>
				</div>
				<h4>DO YOU QUALIFY?</h4>
				<p>How Are You Extraordinary? Put simply, to qualify for the category of O-1B aliens in the ¬¬arts applicants must
				demonstrate that they are prominent in their field. USCIS (Immigration) has a checklist of categories to satisfy this
				requirement. Being either nominated for or winning a major award, such as a Grammy, an Oscar, or an Emmy,
				satisfies this requirement. Barring that, the artist must satisfy 3 of the 6 following categories to demonstrate that
				they qualify:
				Performed and will perform services as a lead or starring participant in productions or events that have a
				distinguished reputation, as evidenced by critical reviews, advertisements, publicity releases, publications, contracts
				or endorsements.
				Achieved national or international recognition for achievements, as shown by critical reviews or other published
				materials by or about the beneficiary in major newspapers, trade journals, magazines or other publications.
				Performed and will perform in a lead, starring or critical role for organizations and establishments that have a
				distinguished reputation, as evidenced by articles in newspapers, trade journals, publications or testimonials.
				Established a record of major commercial successes or critical acclaim, as shown by such indicators as title, rating
				or standing in the field, box office receipts, motion picture or television ratings and other occupational
				achievements reported in trade journals, major newspapers or other publications. Received significant recognition
				for achievements from organizations, critics, government agencies or other recognized experts in the beneficiary’s
				field, with the testimonials clearly indicating the author's authority, expertise and knowledge of the beneficiary's
				achievements.
				A salary or other remuneration for services that is high in relation to others in the field, as shown by contracts or
				other reliable evidence.
				For the purposes of this overview we will summarize the relevant categories for you:</p>
				
				<h5>AWARDS</h5>
				<p>To satisfy this category you must have either won or been nominated for a major national or international award.
				The regulations mention Academy Awards, Emmys and Grammys. If you have won an award that is not at that level
				of a major national or international award then USCIS will most like consider that your award is insufficient for this
				category. Immigration will most likely not consider grants, residencies, or fellowships as satisfying the awards
				category. The current trend is that immigration rarely gives credit for the award category. On the other hand,
				evidence of grants, residencies and other awards are still very important because they help to show your
				significance.</p>

				<h5>LEADING ROLE IN EVENTS</h5>
				<p>For this category you must prove that you have had a leading or starring role in events that are considered
				prestigious. You must also prove that you will be coming to the U.S. to have a lead or starring role in events that are
				considered prestigious.<br>
				An event is something that occurs at a specific time. For example think of a performance in a concert, an artistic
				exhibition, a runway show, a lecture or a workshop. Judging the work of others can also be considered an event.
				Events can be documented as prestigious with articles about the event that mention the artist’s name. Press
				releases, invitation cards, catalogs and online mentions sometimes, but not always, prove that the event is
				prestigious. Promotional material about the event such as advertisements or posters can possibly prove that the
				event is prestigious.<br>
				Most visual artists that are ready to apply for an O-1 have had multiple exhibitions, including solo and group shows.
				In the past, they could satisfy the events category with invitation cards and a press release about an exhibition. Now
				(and in recent years) USCIS also looks for clear evidence that the artist had an important role in the exhibition and
				that the exhibition was in some sense prestigious. <br>
				To prove that the artist will have a leading role once they are in the U.S. we often look for press about the venue of
				the confirmed future event. For example, an art gallery that has been mentioned in the New York Times would be
				prestigious. We also look for press about the clients that the artist will work for (if the applicant is an art director, for
				instance). The key to this idea is to document that you are coming to the U.S. to do something and that there is some
				sort of evidence that this is prestigious. This can be accomplished by showing the venue is prestigious, that the
				actual event is prestigious or that the clients you will work with are prestigious.</p>

				<h2 id="preparations" class="hidden-sm hidden-xs">Preparations</h2>

				<div class="hidden-lg hidden-md col-xs-12 peach bar">
					<h2>Preparations</h2>
				</div>
				<h4>THREE MAIN PARTS OF EACH O-1 VISA APPLICATION</h4>
				<p>1. You must have a petitioner.<br>
				2. You must have confirmed assignments for the term of the visa.<br>
				3. You must qualify for the visa.<br><br><br>
				As discussed above, each beneficiary must have a petitioner who will petition for his or her visa in the United States.
				The petitioner must confirm the assignments for the term of the visa; or the beneficiary must provide contracts
				with the additional employers who will work with the beneficiary if they have multiple employers in a U.S. Agent
				relationship. The beneficiary must demonstrate that they are extraordinary by having been nominated for or having
				received a major national or international award. Or they must demonstrate that they qualify for 3 of the 6
				categories described above. (There is an additional category for “other comparable evidence.”) Strategy and
				Execution of Organizing the Evidence A critical component involves documenting an artist’s career so that their
				credentials clearly fit into the above listed categories. Some material already exists in the world. Examples of
				evidence that already exist would include press by or about the beneficiary, evidence of exhibitions or other events,
				and evidence of awards or other accomplishments. Often in reviewing an artist’s credentials Eric Shaub will make a
				determination of what supporting material should be prepared to bolster the material that already exists about the
				beneficiary. Letters of recommendation can be divided into three types</p>
				<h4>TYPES OF LETTERS</h4>
				<p>Types of Recommendation Letters<br>
				CONFIRMATION LETTERS: A confirmation letter can confirm an award if you do not have an award certificate or
				other proof that you received the award. It can also confirm a lecture you gave, a high fashion model’s participation
				in a runway show, or another type of event. These letters will be discussed with Eric on a case-by-case basis<br>
				CRITICAL ROLE OR CONTRIBUTIONS LETTERS: The purpose of these letters is to confirm that you played a critical
				role with a person, organization, client or event. They can also confirm an artistic collaboration.<br>
				SIGNIFICANCE LETTERS: These are letters from experts in your field who can attest to your significance in your
				field. While critical role letters will focus on the relationship between the artist and the writer of the letter,
				significance letters will be broader. They will describe the writer’s expertise and then offer an opinion about why
				the artist is significant in the industry. These letters will essentially describe all of the artist’s credentials and career
				to describe how the artist is prominent.</p>
				<h4>TRANSLATIONS</h4>
				<p>Translations The regulations regarding translations are quite clear. All evidence that is submitted must be
				submitted with a complete translation. All translations should be accompanied by a certification from someone who
				is fluent in both English and the original language. Before translating all articles or other evidence a consultation
				with Eric’s office can give guidance on what is important and needs translation, and what might be considered less
				important and would not make it into the final application.</p>
				<h4>NEXT STEPS</h4>
				<p>Next Steps Once the evidence has been obtained to document that the alien is extraordinary, and our firm is aware of
				whom the petitioner will be and the alien’s planned itinerary in the United States, we then prepare the forms and cover
				letters that immigration will need to approve the application. Often our firm needs time to organize the file. We then have
				the petitioner sign these documents and return them to us. We are then ready to send the file to immigration.</p>
				<h4>DECISION</h4>
				<p>Decision by USCIS: Approval, Denial or Request for Evidence<br>
				When USCIS receives a file they can approve an application, they can deny an application or they can ask for more
				evidence. Requests for evidence from USCIS can ask for evidence to help clarify that the artist is in fact
				extraordinary or to seek clarification about what an artist will be doing in the United States. Once USCIS approves
				the petition they issue Form I-797 Approval Notice.</p>
				<h4>CONSULAR PROCESSING (O-1)</h4>
				<p>Consular Processing Our office will work with the artist on a consular form called DS-160. This application for the
				US State Department will ask for biographical information and will inquire about prior visas, and seek to uncover any
				problems that make an applicant ineligible for a visa.<br>
				Once the DS-160 has been prepared and generated our office will prepare a packet for the applicant that will
				include a copy of the petition, an updated letter from the petitioner, a copy of the DS-160 consular form with bar
				code and the Approval Notice I-797. Additional documents needed may include pay statements from past employers,
				old passports or other evidence of prior immigration status including I-20s, EAD cards and old approval notices.<br>
				In most instances applicants are required to schedule a personal interview at the consulate. This is often not an
				actual interview, but an in-person appearance at the consulate. Given the heightened border security measures
				currently under effect, the United States Consulates are on the defensive. They do not want to make a mistake, and
				the level of scrutiny on applications is at an all-time high. Our office is aware of this complication and we work
				intensively with all applicants to complete all relevant documentation.
				Most often, the consular officer will take the passport and the related evidence and review it. The officer will then
				return most of the evidence and keep the passport. If the visa is to be issued, the passport is often sent back to the
				applicant by courier or mail in a period of time ranging from one day to three weeks, depending on the consulate
				and the time of year.<br>
				All applicants are screened for prior arrests and a terrorist watch list. If, as is sometimes the case, an applicant triggers a
				flag in the database search the consulate will not issue the visa until the issue is resolved. In the case of a mistake this may
				take a number of weeks or months. If you find yourself in this situation, we will work with you to attempt to resolve it.
				Through careful screening most issues can be identified at the beginning of the application process. In the case of a
				mistake, patience and persistence are our principle tools. While the consular sections can make mistakes, they are also fair
				and they will most often resolve them favorably. This is yet another reason to apply sooner.</p>
				<h4>AFTER VISA ISSUED</h4>
				<p>After Visa Issued From Consulate - Entering the U.S.
				BORDER INSPECTION: Our office advises applicants to take the entire packet that the applicant brought to the
				consulate with them on the plane in case U.S. immigration officials at the border have any questions about the visa.
				For example, they may ask about the artist’s credentials and ask what the artist will be doing in the U.S. for the
				petitioner.</p>

					<h2>Overview</h2>
				</div>
				
				<h5>Legal Permanent Residency</h5>
				<p>A green card holder is known as a Legal Permanent Resident (LPR) and has lawful immigrant status to reside in the
				United States.<br>
				There are a number of ways that foreign nationals get immigrant visas (commonly known as Green Cards). Some
				will get the Green Card through marriage or another family relationship. Some will get it through employment, such
				as through a labor certification process. This firm processes Immigrant Visas under the category of Aliens of
				Extraordinary Ability. This is known as the EB-1 category.</p>
				
				<h4>EB-1</h4>
				<p>The EB-1 has two parts. The first part is always the same. It is called the I-140 or immigrant petition. The second
				part applies only if the first part is approved. Once the I-140 is approved the alien can either apply to adjust their
				status in the US, or they can apply to have an interview at a US Consulate. There are pros and cons for each option.
				Part I: The I-140 petition is necessary for preliminary approval. Part II: After the I-140 is approved the alien will
				obtain permanent residency one of two ways; Adjustment of Status or Consular Processing.</p>

				<h4>I-140 PETITION</h4>
				<h5>Part I: the I-140 petition</h5>
				<p>Extraordinary ability workers in the arts must demonstrate through evidence that already exists that they have
				achieved “sustained national or international acclaim” in their field of expertise, and that if they obtain LPR status in
				the United States that their work will substantially benefit the United States in the future.
				Unlike Aliens in the Arts in O-1 status, a job offer is not required, and it is possible for a foreign national to submit a
				petition for a green card on her own behalf. However, she must intend to come to the United States to continue
				working in his or her field of extraordinary ability. For example, if a foreign national submits evidence to USCIS
				establishing that she is an internationally acclaimed curator, she must intend to continue to work as a curator once
				in the USA as an LPR.</p>

				<h4>STANDARD</h4>
				<h5>Standard of extraordinary ability</h5>
				<p>
					<ul>
						<li>The standard to qualify for a green card based on extraordinary ability are higher than those for an O-1 visa.</li>
						<li>While the standard for the O-1 is “distinction”, the standard for the green card is “sustained national or international
						acclaim.” This is a very high standard that allows USCIS much discretion about whether a case qualifies.</li>
						<li>Moreover, a green card applicant must demonstrate that he or she attained a “level of expertise indicating
						that the individual is one of those few who have risen to the top” of the field of endeavor.</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				
				<h4>EVIDENCE</h4>
				<h5>Evidence of Extraordinary Ability</h5>
				<p>In order to qualify for the I-140 the applicant must satisfy two parts of a test:
				<ul class="no-bullets">
					<li>1. Determine whether the petitioner or self-petitioner has submitted the required evidence that meets
					the parameters for each type of evidence listed at 8 CFR 204.5(h)(3); and</li>
					<br>
					<li>2. Determine whether the evidence submitted is sufficient to demonstrate that the beneficiary or
					self-petitioner meets the required high level of expertise for the extraordinary ability immigrant
					classification during a final merits determination.</li>
				</ul>
				If a petitioner has submitted the requisite evidence, USCIS determines whether the evidence demonstrates both a
				“level of expertise indicating that the individual is one of that small percentage who have risen to the very top of
				the[ir] field of endeavor,” 8 C.F.R. § 204.5(h)(2), and “that the alien has sustained national or international acclaim and
				that his or her achievements have been recognized in the field of expertise.” 8 C.F.R. § 204.5(h)(3). Only aliens whose
				achievements have garnered “sustained national or international acclaim” are eligible for an “extraordinary ability”
				visa. 8 U.S.C. § 1153(b)(1)(A)(i).</p>

				<div class="hidden-lg hidden-md col-xs-12 green bar">
					<h2>Initial Documentation</h2>
				</div>

				<h5>Part I: The I-140 petition summary</h5>
				<p>The I-140 requires that the alien satisfy all three of the following:
					<ul class="no-buletts">
					<li>SUBPART A: The alien must demonstrate that they have won a major international prize such as a Nobel
					Prize or else successfully prove that they satisfy three of ten categories of criteria.</li><br>
					<li>SUBPART B: The Alien must have substantial evidence about their career so that USCIS can make a
					determination about their application. The USCIS review is called the Final Merits Determination. USCIS
					will review all of the evidence in the record in its totality from Part A to determine if it is more likely than
					not that the alien has sustained national or international acclaim and is one of that small percentage who
					has risen to the very top of the field of endeavor.</li><br>
					<li>SUBPART C: The alien must prove they are coming to the US to continue to work in their field and that
					they will not become a public charge.</li>

				<h4>PART A (3 OF 10)</h4>
				<p><h5>I-40 Subpart A</h5>
				The first part of the test would require the applicant to be either the winner of a major international award such as a Nobel
				Prize, or she should provide documentation of three of the following ten categories to document Extraordinary Ability.
					<ul>
						<li><h5>i. LESSER PRIZES OR AWARDS</h5>
						Documentation of the alien's receipt of lesser nationally or internationally recognized prizes or
						awards for excellence in the field of endeavor; The trend with this category is that USCIS wants very
						strong evidence that the prize is a national or international award. The trend is that the alien has to win
						the award (not just be a finalist) and that the award has to be national or international. Grants and
						Biennials are not considered good evidence for this category. If the documentation does not say either
						national prize or international prize somewhere in the documentation then USCIS will most likely not
						grant this category.</li><br>
						<li><h5>ii. MEMBERSHIP</h5>
						Documentation of the alien's membership in associations in the field for which classification is sought,
						which requires outstanding achievements of their members, as judged by recognized national or
						international experts in their disciplines or fields; the trend here is a request for proof that the
						membership is very selective.</li><br>
						<li><h5>iii. PRESS</h5>
						Published material about the alien in professional or major trade publications or other major media,
						relating to the alien's work in the field for which classification is sought. Such evidence shall include
						the title, date, and author of the material, and any necessary translation; This is probably the most
						important category since it also demonstrates evidence of sustained acclaim, toward proving the second
						part of the test. The recent trends are as follows: USCIS is being very strict about whether the press is in
						a major trade publication or major media. If something is regional at all they will most likely not consider
						this as strong evidence. Their preference is for scans of newspapers or magazines as opposed to the
						online version of the same. If the article is in a foreign language the article must be completely translated
						or it will not be considered by immigration. The article should be principally about the alien. Mentions of
						an artist as part of a group show will most likely not count. The trend is that immigration is looking for
						multiple articles and not just one article. The more articles that an alien has that fulfills all of this criteria
						the stronger the application. If an alien’s profession is in the arts and they do not satisfy these criteria
						then under the current standards of immigration it might not be worth applying at this time.</li><br>
						<li><h5>iv. JUDGE OF OTHERS</h5>
						Evidence of the alien's participation, either individually or on a panel, as a judge of the work of others
						in the same or an allied field of specification for which classification is sought; Importantly there must
						be evidence that an alien actually participated as the judge. So, a letter inviting an artist to be a judge
						does not satisfy this category. On the other hand, if the alien has participated as a judge and this can be
						documented with evidence then this is a category that immigration often grants to aliens in the arts. If
						an alien is considering a green card application and they have not served in the capacity as a juror then
						this firm strongly recommends that the alien do this. Examples of jury membership can include:
						evidence of being on a jury for a competition in the field. We have also had success when an alien has
						served on a committee that gives out grants, or on a committee that selects artists for an artist residency.</li><br>
						<li><h5>v. SIGNIFICANCE</h5>
						Evidence of the alien's original scientific, scholarly, artistic, athletic, or business-related contributions
						of major significance in the field; The trend is that no one gets awarded this category. In order to
						succeed the alien must prove their contribution is original. Think about it this way: is anyone writing
						textbooks about what you are doing? If not then you would most likely not qualify in this category.<li><br>
						</li><h5>vi. SCHOLARLY ARTICLES</h5>
						Evidence of the alien's authorship of scholarly articles in the field, in professional or major trade
						publications or other major media; Scholarly articles are the type of articles that a professor publishes in
						a scientific journal. Articles that an art critic writes in a magazine do not satisfy this category. Similarly
						catalog essays do not satisfy this category. The questions to ask include: is the article published in a
						scholarly publication? Does the article have footnotes? USCIS has a strong “nose” for what is and is not a
						scholarly article. They have many applications by scientists and professors. They know what a scholarly
						article is. They will not give the benefit of the doubt if this article is not a legitimate scholarly article.</li><br>
						<li><h5>vii. EXHIBITIONS AND SHOWCASES</h5>
						Evidence of the display of the alien's work in the field at artistic exhibitions or showcases; the
						adjudicative trend is that artists generally are granted this category. There has to be more than one
						exhibition to qualify. There should be substantial evidence to prove that the alien exhibited their work
						and that it was an artistic exhibition. This category generally does not work as well for musicians and
						fashion designers since immigration explains that concerts or fashion shows are what these professionals
						all do in their field as part of their day-to-day activity. That being said a professional artist with many
						shows would most likely qualify for this category, especially if there are a number of solo exhibitions.
						Evidence of Museum Shows, Art Biennials or high end gallery solo shows will also be stronger evidence to
						help with the second part of the test.</li><br>
						<li><h5>viii. CRITICAL ROLE</h5>
						Evidence that the alien has performed in a leading or critical role for organizations or establishments
						that have a distinguished reputation; some occupations are more suited to this category then others.
						Any occupation where the alien has worked for an employer for many years would have a stronger chance
						of satisfying this category. For example, an architect or graphic designer, or a curator with a museum
						might be able to document a strong critical role with an organization. We have had success with artists
						who have gallery representation if we can prove the artist has had a leading role with that gallery by
						having multiple high profile exhibitions. One time exhibitions or one-time involvements will generally
						not succeed with this category these days.</li><br>
						<li><h5>ix. HIGH REMUNERATION</h5>
						Evidence that the alien has commanded a high salary or other significantly high remuneration for
						services, in relation to others in the field; in some occupations, for example Art Directors in Ad Firms,
						the alien receives a salary. There are online surveys, which can document whether the salary is high
						compared to others. Artists can also get letters from their galleries if they earn a large amount from that
						gallery over time. One time payments or sales would most likely not satisfy this category.</li><br>
						<li><h5>x. COMMERCIAL SUCCESS</h5>
						Evidence of commercial successes in the performing arts, as shown by box office receipts or record,
						cassette, compact disk, or video sales. This category applies to musicians, movie stars, film directors and
						others whose work might appear on charts (Billboard 100 for example).</li><br>
						<li>If the above standards do not readily apply to the beneficiary's occupation, the petitioner may submit
						comparable evidence to establish the beneficiary's eligibility. The adjudicative trend is that immigration
						will not give weight to this category unless the occupation does not suit itself to the above ten categories.</li>
					</ul>

				<h4>PART B THE FINAL MERITS DETERMINATION</h4>
				<p>I-140 Part B: The Final Merits Determination
				If you are able to show that you meet at least 3 of the above regulatory criteria, USCIS will then review all of the
				evidence in the record in its totality to determine if it is more likely than not that you have sustained national or
				international acclaim and are one of that small percentage who has risen to the very top of the field of endeavor. To
				satisfy the Final Merits Determination the alien should put their best application together so that immigration can
				review all of the evidence and approve the case. This part is relatively subjective and USCIS has great discretion in
				determining whether an alien is successful. The stronger the evidence is in terms of an alien’s achievements in the
				field compared to others, the more efficiently and accurately USCIS can process the petition. Ultimately it is this
				risk of failing the Final Merits Determination that can foil what would otherwise be a successful application. To
				some extent a letter or memo from the attorney can help explain why the alien qualifies to be approved.
				Realistically, however, the alien should understand that there is risk in this type of application and that even if they
				feel they clearly qualify in the I-140 part A they nevertheless could be unsuccessful in Part B.</p>
				
				<h4>PART C: FUTURE OFFERS I-140</h4>
				<p>The alien must prove they are coming to the US to continue to work in their field and that they will not become a
				public charge.
				Evidence of Part C can include: Letters from current or prospective employers; documents evidencing prearranged
				commitments (such as contracts); and a statement from the alien detailing their plans on how they intend to
				continue working in their field in the United States.</p>
				
				<h2  id="proceed" class="hidden-sm hidden-xs">Ways To Proceed</h2>
				<div class="hidden-lg hidden-md col-xs-12 green bar">
					<h2>Ways To Proceed</h2>
				</div>

				<h4>SEND FILE TO USCIS</h4>
				<p><h5>Sending the file to USCIS</h5>
				When USCIS receives the file they will either approve the application, deny the application or ask for more
				information so that they can either approve or deny the application. The request for more information is called
				Request for Evidence. If the application is approved the applicant can continue to the second part of the
				application.</p>
				<h4>UPON APPROVAL</h4>
				<p><h5>After I-140 Petition is approved Part II:</h5>
				After the I-140 is approved the alien will obtain permanent residency one of two ways: Adjustment of Status or
				Consular Processing</p>
				<h4>ADJUSTMENT OF STATUS</h4>
				<p>Adjustment of Status requires that the alien file the application while they are in the United States in valid
				non-immigrant status. That means you have to have an unexpired non-immigrant visa in order to file. If that is the
				case and you have an approved I-140 you should gather evidence that you always complied with your non-immigrant
				status. This means that for former students you must hold copies of all of your I-20s. If you had other visas such as
				O-1 visas you should have copies of all approval notices and all prior visas. The law allows adjustment of status when
				the applicant has never been out of status for even one day. It may be possible that a person is in valid O1 status but
				that at some point in the past they stayed in the US longer then they were allowed or had another type of status
				violation. Unless an applicant can document their entire O-1 status it is the opinion of this firm that they can suffer
				severe delays in finishing up the O1 process and in fact the process can ultimately be denied. Applicants who have
				been in the US for many years or for those that have not kept copies of all of their immigration paperwork should
				not attempt Adjustment of Status but should instead seek to process the second part of their visa at their home
				consulate.<br>
				An advantage of Adjustment of Status is that once the applicant files to adjust their status they no longer have their
				former status and now have the new status called “Pending Adjustment of Status.” So, for example, if an applicant
				has an O-1 visa that is expiring in March and they file their application a month earlier, in February, then they would
				not need to renew their O-1 visa status so long as they filed in a timely manner.<br>
				When an applicant files adjustment of status they file three applications. One application is called the application to
				adjust status. This is called the I-485. The other applications are called application for employment authorization
				I-765 and application for advanced parole I-131. Once these additional applications are processed the applicant will
				be free to travel outside of the US and work in the US for whomever they would like. Note that until the advanced
				parole card is received the applicant cannot travel outside of the US. If the applicant leaves the US before they
				receive their advanced parole document their application is considered abandoned. Note as well that there is a
				black out period of anywhere from 3-6 months from when an applicant filed their adjustment of status before they
				can normally travel. Thus applicants who have extensive travel commitments, or those who have relatives in poor
				health should not apply for adjustment of status but should instead apply for consular processing.</p>
				<h4>CONSULAR PROCESSING (GREEN CARD)</h4>
				<p><h5>Consular Processing</h5>
				The second option for finishing the green card process is called Consular Processing. The end result is an interview
				at the US Consulate in the home country of the applicant. Note that there is generally only one consulate per
				country that handles the applications. So, for example, in Germany all interviews are held in Frankfurt for
				immigrant visas. The process is as follows: After the approval of the I-140 (the first part of the application) USCIS
				will forward the application to the National Visa Center. The timing of this can range from one to three months but
				can take longer. After the National Visa Center receives the application they will make a fee request by email. The
				applicant will pay that fee from their bank account and can then move on to the next phase, which is submitting
				their DS-260 consular form and their civil documents. The civil documents will include documents such as: birth
				certificates, marriage certificates, divorce decrees, the birth certificates of any children, a copy of their passport
				biographical (photo) page as well as any evidence of military service. If the applicant has ever been arrested they will
				need evidence of the disposition of the arrest.<br>
				After submitting the civil documents and forms DS-260 the National Visa Center has to complete their processing
				and when the processing is complete they will notify the Consulate to schedule the interview. In general the
				processing time from USCIS approval of the I-140 until the immigrant interview is normally within the range of 6-8
				months. The timing of receiving an immigrant visa after an interview can depend from consulate to consulate and is
				often a week after the interview. Once the applicant receives their immigrant visa they will pay an additional fee
				called the ELIS fee. This should be paid before the applicant enters the US. When the consulate issues the visa they
				also send out a sealed envelope. The applicant will take the unopened sealed envelope with the immigrant visa and
				will present that to the US CIS officer in the US. That officer will update the computer and stamp the passport. At
				that point the immigrant is a permanent resident of the US. The green card is only evidence of the status that has
				already been received. The card is sent in the mail often a month or so after entry into the US.<br>
				One advantage of consular processing is that the timing is very predicable and is not often longer than that timeline.
				As opposed to adjustment of status, which can be 4 months but can be more than three years or longer on occasion,
				the consular processing timeline is very consistent.<br>
				It should be noted that for consular processing the applicant must maintain non-immigrant visa status until they
				leave the US to have their immigrant interview. An applicant can travel freely in and out of the United States so long
				as their current non-immigrant visa allows it, but the only time the benefit of this application accrues to an
				applicant is after the applicant returns as permanent resident. So, for example, an O-1 visa holder who has not yet
				been scheduled for their final interview may be faced with either extending their O1 visa in the US to maintain their
				status, or, in some instances, leaving the US to obtain one more O1 visa even though they might to scheduled for
				their immigrant visas a few months later. Under that scenario, an applicant can choose to move their immigrant visa
				interview at a later date, such as 6 months later.<br>
				Medical Exam: If the applicant is filing by adjustment of status they must have a medical exam from a Civil Surgeon
				on the approved list of USCIS. The medical exam will make sure the applicant is healthy and does not have an
				infectious disease. The doctor will give the applicant inoculations unless they can prove that they have already
				received the inoculations on the US CIS list.<br>
				If the applicant applies for consular processing the medical exam must take place before the interview. Depending
				upon the applicant’s travel plans they would need to have the medical exam on a prior trip to their country or they
				will need to travel to the country with enough time to process the medical exam before the interview.</p>
